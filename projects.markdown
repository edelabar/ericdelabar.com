Most of my code of note lives in [github](http://github.com/edelabar) now.  Lease check it out if you're interested.  One day I might implement on of my ideas, and when I do, it'll live here.  Until then, here are some things I work on and semi-actively maintain.  

## Web Work

* [Manifesto](https://manifesto.ericdelabar.com/) - A quick little bookmarklet I put together to debug `cache.manifest` file syntax for offline web apps.  The source lives on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/manifesto/) if you're interested.  I wouldn't call it actively-maintained but [I've recently heard](https://twitter.com/emad_alghamdi/status/548795991772512256) it still works...
* [North Catasauqua website](https://northcatasauqua.org/) - I did some work to get my hometown on the web.  I setup and tweaked [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) for their needs and help when they have questions.
* [Catasauqua Area Showcase Theatre (CAST) website](https://www.cattytheatre.org/) - Set this up years ago and keep it up-to-date code-wise, content is actively maintained by the organization.
* This website - See the [Colophon](/colophon.html) for details on the design and code.

## Apps

* [Check-Out Sender](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/check-out-sender/id1363283964?ls=1&mt=8) for iOS - Check-Out Sender sends a templated email to a given email address. It was designed to work with the policies at my kids' school district, but maybe it can work with yours too.
* [ChannelScrobbler](/projects/channelscrobbler.html) for OS X - My first built-from-scratch Mac app in the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/channelscrobbler-post-your/id994537604?mt=12). ChannelScrobbler sits in your status bar and posts your Last.fm scrobbles to a Slack channel in real-time.
* [Cues](/projects/cues.html) for iPad (Coming Soon!) - Cues: The Audio Engineer's Teleprompter is designed to provide cues and sound effects for running the sound board for a live theatre production.  Cues uses an act and scene based interface to provide hints on what microphone or sound board channels to bring up or down for a given scene in a show.
* [StoryboardMerge](https://github.com/marcinolawski/StoryboardMerge) for OS X - I didn't create it, but [@marcinolawski](https://github.com/marcinolawski) merged in a pull request of mine that allows it to be used as a [git mergetool](https://github.com/marcinolawski/StoryboardMerge#how-to-use-as-a-git-mergetool) for dealing with merging Xcode storyboard files.  If you do Cocoa development in a team it's work a look!
* [Allentown Lights in the Parkway Display Builder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/allentown-lights-in-parkway/id577516838?mt=8) for iOS - I built this app by myself in 3-weeks back in 2012 as an employee of [Trifecta Technologies, Inc.](https://www.trifecta.com/).  It hasn't been updated since, but still works on my iPad running iOS 8.1.  It never had a ton of downloads and I'm not sure if it even accomplished its goal of giving people something to do while waiting in line for the [Allentown Lights in the Parkway](https://www.lightsintheparkway.com/) display, but my kids still like to play with it.
