Cues: The Audio Engineer's Teleprompter is designed to provide cues and sound effects for running the sound board for a live theatre production.  Cues uses an act and scene based interface to provide hints on what microphone or sound board channels to bring up or down for a given scene in a show.  It also provides the facility to play sound effect mp3 files by hooking your iPad's audio out to your sound board.  Mp3 files can be loaded from any application that provides an "Open In..." option, like [Dropbox](https://db.tt/wUQxoIj) or [Box](http://www.box.com/).

Features:
* Light-on-dark interface for darkened theaters.
* Large-text interface for easy visibility.
* Create cues by visual prompts like entrances or exits or by character lines.
* Color-coded cues for visual differentiation.
* Cues can specify one or more microphones/channels or a single sound effect.
* Sound effects can be any mp3 file.
* Run-once sound effects or looping, multiple-scene ambient sounds.

Cues is currently in the App Store review process and will be available soon!
