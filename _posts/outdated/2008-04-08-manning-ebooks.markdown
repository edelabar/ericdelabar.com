# Manning eBooks

Last week at the [Emerging Tech Conference](http://www.phillyemergingtech.com/) I dropped my card in the 
fishbowl at the [Manning Publications](http://www.manning.com/) table to win a free eBook.  Turns out 
I actually won!  This morning in my e-mail I found a free eBook copy of Groovy in Action.  I haven't read any of 
it yet, but I would like to thank Manning for the book, and I will definitely write up a review when I've had some 
time to read though it.

Until then, if you're interested, [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) is a scripting language that 
runs in the Java Virtual Machine.  Until the Emerging Tech Conference I really was not all that interested in 
[Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/), but then I saw a presentation on 
[Grails](http://grails.codehaus.org/), a 
[Ruby-on-Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com/) like application framework that uses 
[Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) instead of 
[Ruby](http://www2.ruby-lang.org/en/20020101.html).  The neat thing about 
[Grails](http://grails.codehaus.org/) is that it's really just a wrapper around a 
[Spring Framework](http://www.springframework.org/) back-end, including a 
[Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/)-based persistence layer. I still need a chance to play with 
the whole stack, but it's definitely on my list of things to do because it offers a lot of the neat things about 
<acronym title="Ruby-on-Rails">RoR</acronym> without learning an entirely new language and set of libraries.  So far 
the only downfall I see is that like <acronym title="Ruby-on-Rails">RoR</acronym>, Grails really doesn't run on a shared 
(read cheap) hosting setup, so if you want to put a Grails app into production you probably need a Java App Server, 
which typically costs quite a bit more the [PHP](http://www.php.net/) hosting.
