<h1>Manning eBooks</h1>
<p>Last week at the <a href="http://www.phillyemergingtech.com/">Emerging Tech Conference</a> I dropped my card in the fishbowl at the <a href="http://www.manning.com/">Manning Publications</a> table to win a free eBook.  Turns out I actually won!  This morning in my e-mail I found a free eBook copy of Groovy in Action.  I haven't read any of it yet, but I would like to thank Manning for the book, and I will definitely write up a review when I've had some time to read though&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Until then, if you're interested, <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> is a scripting language that runs in the Java Virtual Machine.  Until the Emerging Tech Conference I really was not all that interested in <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>, but then I saw a presentation on <a href="http://grails.codehaus.org/">Grails</a>, a <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby-on-Rails</a> like application framework that uses <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> instead of <a href="http://www2.ruby-lang.org/en/20020101.html">Ruby</a>.  The neat thing about <a href="http://grails.codehaus.org/">Grails</a> is that it's really just a wrapper around a <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring Framework</a> back-end, including a <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>-based persistence layer. I still need a chance to play with the whole stack, but it's definitely on my list of things to do because it offers a lot of the neat things about <abbr title="Ruby-on-Rails">RoR</abbr> without learning an entirely new language and set of libraries.  So far the only downfall I see is that like <abbr title="Ruby-on-Rails">RoR</abbr>, Grails really doesn't run on a shared (read cheap) hosting setup, so if you want to put a Grails app into production you probably need a Java App Server, which typically costs quite a bit more the <a href="http://www.php.net/"><span class="caps">PHP</span></a>&nbsp;hosting.</p>
