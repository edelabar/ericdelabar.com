# Going Naked for a Few Days

In case you're wondering, this site has no styles applied to it.  I've done this so that I can craft the XHTML 
and WordPress theme to perfection.  After I'm happy with the markup, I'll begin making it pretty.  I swear, 
I'm really going to do it this time.  Changes are coming down the pipe, including the start of a few new projects 
like a WordPress theme and some plugins to make WordPress behave the way I think it should.  I guess only time 
will tell, but hopefully the next post to this blog won't be in a year...
