I won't be at the [TheServerSide Java Symposium](http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/) this year, 
but I will be going to [JavaOne](http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/).  To hold me off until then 
I'm heading down to the [Philly Emerging Technologies for the Enterprise](http://www.phillyemergingtech.com/) 
at [Drexel](http://www.drexel.edu/).  It looks like the typical pipe-dream of a java conference 
with the requisite talks on agile development and web 2.0; although their definition of web 2.0 seem more like 
<acronym title="Rich Internet Applications">RIA</acronym> with 
[Flex](http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/) than my 
[preferred definition](/2007/02/web-20-religion-politics.html).  As of now, I think I'll be in the 
following sessions:
