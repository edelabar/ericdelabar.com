Day one of the conference was pretty interesting, definitely better in the morning that the afternoon, 
but at least lunch was good!  The Keynote was interesting, by [Lucinda Holt](http://www.cerealceo.com/) 
from [Commerce360](http://www.commerce360.com/), an impressive look at being in the right place 
at the right time and choosing the best horse to back.  The first session, on the 
[changes in Spring 2.5](http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/new-in-2.html), 
was interesting, but nothing new since I've had my nose in the 2.5 docs since the version was released. 
The second session I attended was on [Grails](http://grails.codehaus.org/), hugely interesting, 
and I can't wait to play with it!  The [speaker](http://www.phillyemergingtech.com/speakers.php#rimple" title="Ken Rimple) 
was spectacular, and technology itself looks a lot more promising than <acronym title="Ruby-on-Rails">RoR</acronym> 
because it compiles to byte code and is deployed to a standard Java app server.

After lunch the Ruby session on Metaprogramming was fascinating from a geek perspective, but provided very 
little in terms of business use for a Java programmer, or a Ruby programmer for that matter.  Finally, I'm 
sitting in an OSGi presentation which is so interesting I'm writing this blog post.  Oh well, tomorrow looks 
to be a little more interesting.
