<h1>Philly Emerging Tech Day 1</h1>
<p>Day one of the conference was pretty interesting, definitely better in the morning that the afternoon, but at least lunch was good!  The Keynote was interesting, by <a href="http://www.cerealceo.com/">Lucinda Holt</a> from <a href="http://www.commerce360.com/">Commerce360</a>, an impressive look at being in the right place at the right time and choosing the best horse to back.  The first session, on the <a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/new-in-2.html">changes in Spring 2.5</a>, was interesting, but nothing new since I've had my nose in the 2.5 docs since the version was released.  The second session I attended was on <a href="http://grails.codehaus.org/">Grails</a>, hugely interesting, and I can't wait to play with it!  The <a href="http://www.phillyemergingtech.com/speakers.php#rimple" title="Ken Rimple">speaker</a> was spectacular, and technology itself looks a lot more promising than <abbr title="Ruby-on-Rails">RoR</abbr> because it compiles to byte code and is deployed to a standard Java app&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>After lunch the Ruby session on Metaprogramming was fascinating from a geek perspective, but provided very little in terms of business use for a Java programmer, or a Ruby programmer for that matter.  Finally, I'm sitting in an OSGi presentation which is so interesting I'm writing this blog post.  Oh well, tomorrow looks to be a little more&nbsp;interesting.</p>
