<h1>Web 2.0 &ndash; Religion &amp; Politics</h1>
<p>First, a separation of church and state. I did not coin the term Web 2.0, and I have no particular feelings towards it (either for or against.) What I do feel is that the <strong>idea</strong> of Web 2.0 has put a few very important issues onto the&nbsp;map.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Standards Compliant and Semantic&nbsp;<span class="caps">HTML</span></li>
	<li>Cascading Style Sheets&nbsp;(<span class="caps">CSS</span>)</li>
	<li>Client Side Scripting&nbsp;(JavaScript)</li>
	<li>Usability</li>
	<li>Accessibility</li>
	<li>Ajax</li>
</ul>
<p>This blog aims to discuss these issues and more from a technical aspect. I hope to provided tutorials, insights, and best practices for front-end development; but where necessary, back-end code will be provided in either Ruby-on-Rails or&nbsp;Java.</p>
<p>So that's it, let's see where it goes from&nbsp;here!</p>
