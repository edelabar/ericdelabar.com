# Web 2.0 &ndash; Religion &amp; Politics

First, a separation of church and state. I did not coin the term Web 2.0, and I have no particular feelings 
towards it (either for or against.) What I do feel is that the **idea** of Web 2.0 has put a few very important 
issues onto the map.

* Standards Compliant and Semantic HTML
* Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
* Client Side Scripting (JavaScript)
* Usability
* Accessibility
* Ajax

This blog aims to discuss these issues and more from a technical aspect. I hope to provided tutorials, insights, 
and best practices for front-end development; but where necessary, back-end code will be provided in either 
Ruby-on-Rails or Java.

So that's it, let's see where it goes from here!
