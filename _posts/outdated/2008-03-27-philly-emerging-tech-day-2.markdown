Loved the keynote this morning by [Floyd Marinescu](http://www.floydmarinescu.com/) the 
CEO of [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/), it probably would have 
been better yesterday because it introduced a lot of the technologies being covered in the individual 
presentations, but beyond that, very interesting.

Next, I checked out [OpenLaszlo 4.0 - Java ME, Ajax and beyond](http://www.phillyemergingtech.com/abstracts.php#carlson), 
I wasn't too interested, so I don't have much to say.  Next, I attended 
[WS-* vs. REST: Myths, Facts and Lies](http://www.phillyemergingtech.com/abstracts.php#freemantle2) by 
[Paul Fremantle](http://pzf.fremantle.org/) of 
[WSO<sub>2</sub>](http://wso2.com/).  Paul's presentation was 
excellent and incredibly informative on both SOAP-based 
web services and [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) services.

As with yesterday, the afternoon was not as good as the morning, I attended 
[Designing RESTful Rails Applications](http://www.phillyemergingtech.com/abstracts.php#fernandez) which 
was mainly because of wanting more information on RESTful applications.  This one was a little too 
[Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/)-centric for my taste, but it exposed a flaw in 
REST that eliminated some of the wow-factor in the concept.  Apparently 
HTML does not allow for HTTP requests of the non-GET or POST variety such as DELETE or 
PUT, which means a web-based front-end is not purely possible.  Apparently 
Rails works around this, but I'm not thrilled with that solution either.

Finally, I attended an excellent presentation on [Hibernate Search](http://www.phillyemergingtech.com/abstracts.php#bernard) by 
[Emmanuel Bernard](http://blog.emmanuelbernard.com/index.html). 
[Hibernate Search](http://www.hibernate.org/410.html) is a system designed to capitalize on 
[Lucene's](http://lucene.apache.org/) indexing ability in conjunction with Hibernate annotations 
in order to map search results to Hibernate entities.  Very cool, and definitely on my list of things to play with.
