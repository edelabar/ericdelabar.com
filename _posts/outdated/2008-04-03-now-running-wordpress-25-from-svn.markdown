<h1>Now running WordPress 2.5 from SVN</h1>
<p>Since I found out that <a href="http://www.happycog.com/">HappyCog</a> <a href="http://www.jasonsantamaria.com/archive/2008/03/31/wordpress_admin_redesign.php">redid the admin for WordPress 2.5</a> I've been interested to see what it looks like.  This morning I decided it was time.  I originally used the <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?146279">DreamHost</a> <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/One_Click_Installs">one-click install</a> to setup my initial install, and although it is a nice feature, I decided that <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing/Updating_WordPress_with_Subversion"><span class="caps">SVN</span> was more my thing</a>.  <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing/Updating_WordPress_with_Subversion#Converting_a_.22Traditional.22_WordPress_Blog_to_a_Subversion_Checkout">Going through the steps provided was pretty simple</a>, and my upgrade was complete in about five minutes&nbsp;total.</p>
<p>As far as compatibility, all of my existing plugins "worked" but the <a href="http://www.arnebrachhold.de/projects/wordpress-plugins/google-xml-sitemaps-generator/"><span class="caps">XML</span> Sitemap plug-in</a> looks a little funny thanks to the new admin design.  While I was at it I added the <a href="http://www.clickpass.com/docs/wordpress-plugin">ClickPass plugin</a> as a follow-up to <a href="/2008/04/identity-and-openid.html">my recent foray into OpenID</a>.  I'm not sure it's working correctly, I can login with my ClickPass account (which I'm assuming is cookie based), but have been unsuccessful merging my <a href="http://openid.delabar.org/eric" rel="me">preferred OpenID</a>, or even the one <a href="http://www.technorati.com/people/technorati/edelabar" rel="me">Technorati</a> provides.  I will have to look into that one a little further, but until then, no ClickPass for&nbsp;me.</p>
