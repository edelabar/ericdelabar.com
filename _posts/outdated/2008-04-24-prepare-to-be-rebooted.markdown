Today is the last chance for a whole week to check out my archives, tomorrow at 10AM EDT this 
site will be replaced by the May 1 Reboot placeholder as per the rules. After that and until 
May 1, I will be working furiously to design and implement the best website I've ever done. 
So, check back on May first at 10AM EDIT (2PM UTC) to see the first official release of EricDeLabar.com.
