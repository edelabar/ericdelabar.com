# Best Laid Plans

I tried.  I even had a rough draft; but when I went to try out my concept it didn't work.  My article on Friday 
was supposed to be on 301 redirecting from the old [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) URL structure to a new URL 
structure, but after doing my research, I'm not sure it's even possible.  My guess is mod_redirect ignores URL 
parameters, but I definitely need to do some more homework.

The problem I was trying to solve is that 
[Google has quite a few of my pages indexed](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Awww.ericdelabar.com&amp;btnG=Google+Search), 
but they're in the wrong permalink structure and I'd like to convert them to the friendlier structure that I have now. 
Looking around the web there are a [few](http://urbangiraffe.com/plugins/advanced-permalinks/) 
[WordPress](http://www.deanlee.cn/wordpress/permalinks-migration-plugin/) 
[plug-ins](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/permalinks-moved-permanently/#post-2209) that are 
supposed to help you migrate, but it seems they only migrate from one non-default structure to another. 
Currently, most of the links still work, but I'd prefer to have the new structure in the 
<acronym title="Search Engine Result Page">SERP</acronym>s to gain the 
<acronym title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</acronym> benefits of having keywords in a 
URL.

So, as of now, the plan is to solve my problem and then post the article.  Hopefully, if all goes well, 
there will also be another new article on this coming Friday, but only time will tell.
