My blogroll needs some love.  I'm looking for some quality blogs out there who are just starting up.  They 
should be on a similar topic, somewhere close to SEO, 
CSS, JavaScript, Web Standards, and/or Java Programming, but that's really 
open for negotiation.

Here's my problem, my co-workers don't blog, I doubt most of them have even heard of Wordpress, and nobody 
really has enough of a passion to take the time to write.  So, if you've got a young blog, or you know of 
a blog on a similar topic, please send me a link in a comment.  I'm looking for blogs that update often, 
or at least regularly, because I need some fresh, on-topic content to comment on and discuss.  Who's out 
there?  This is not a link exchange request, I don't expect reciprocation, but I wouldn't complain if you 
did, and please don't spam me with links to non-related sites.

In other news, I've come across a few interesting Wordpress plugins that I'm going to be trying out, 
[wp-typogrify](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-typogrify/), and 
[Registered Users Only](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/registered-users-only/) (not for 
this blog).  So, look for those changes and if I find anything interesting about them I'll let you know!
