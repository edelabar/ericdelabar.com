# Welcome Bokardo Readers!

If you're here because of Josh Porter's posts on [social network](http://bokardo.com/archives/the-power-of-niche-social-network-sites/ "The Power of Niche Social Sites at Bokardo.com") 
and [social niche](http://bokardo.com/archives/bootstrapping-a-niche-social-network/ "Bootstrapping a Niche Social Site at Bokardo.com") 
sites on his blog [Bokardo](http://bokardo.com/), you might find these posts interesting:
