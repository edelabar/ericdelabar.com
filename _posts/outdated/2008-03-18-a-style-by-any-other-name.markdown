<h1>A Style by Any Other Name</h1>
<p>Ah, creativity.  As always, I'm in search of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse">muse</a>.  Now I have a rather plain looking website just begging for some style.  I'm moderately happy with the markup, and I feel comfortable enough with <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>' theming capabilities that I'm ready start making this site look like something.  The problem is&nbsp;what?</p>
<p>I'm a t-shirt and jeans type of guy, so it can't be too formal.  Musically, I'm <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock">punk-rock</a> influenced with a touch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emo">emo</a> and an appreciation for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_floyd">classic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_stones">rock</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz">jazz</a> of the non-smooth variety, and I've been known to let my musical influences define me, which makes me think grunge may be the way to go.  I'm 100% Web 2.0, so a little bit of shine is a must, but not so much to be&nbsp;cliche.</p>
<p>What does that leave me with?  I don't know.  I guess it's off to <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing</a> for some&nbsp;ideas.</p>
