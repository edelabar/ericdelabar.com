# A Style by Any Other Name

Ah, creativity.  As always, I'm in search of a [muse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse).  Now I have a rather plain looking 
website just begging for some style.  I'm moderately happy with the markup, and I feel comfortable enough with 
[WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/)' theming capabilities that I'm ready start making this site look like something.  
The problem is what?

I'm a t-shirt and jeans type of guy, so it can't be too formal.  Musically, I'm [punk-rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock) 
influenced with a touch of [emo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emo) and an appreciation for the 
[classic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_floyd) [rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_stones) 
and [jazz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz) of the non-smooth variety, and I've been known to let my musical influences 
define me, which makes me think grunge may be the way to go.  I'm 100% Web 2.0, so a little bit of shine is a must, but not 
so much to be cliche.

What does that leave me with?  I don't know.  I guess it's off to [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/) for 
some ideas.
