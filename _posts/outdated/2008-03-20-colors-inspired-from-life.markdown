# Colors, Inspired from Life

Yesterday I listed quite a few sites from which I picked a few aspects of design that I liked.  I was looking more 
towards the layout and feel than the color but I did note a few palettes that I liked.  Yesterday evening I was 
shopping in my local Old Navy and I noticed the colors being used in the decorations for the men's side of the store. 
A solid brown wash with blue and white "boxes" and orange circles.  I liked it so I snapped a quick picture with my 
phone and after playing for a while with different shades I came up with something like this.

<img src="images/color-study.gif" border="0" alt="color_study.gif" width="400" height="276" class="clear">
	
It's pretty abstract for now, and it doesn't offer any of the texture or depth I'm looking for, but as a palette, 
I'm very happy.

To add to my list from yesterday, I love the footer on [Design View](http://www.andyrutledge.com/styling-text-links.php#fragment-1) and 
[5thirtyone's homepage](http://5thirtyone.com/) is amazing 
([Derek Punsalan's portfolio](http://is.derekpunsalan.com/) is also very impressive, I love the header 
and footer, but they're not really what I'm looking for).  Of course since I'm considering brown, I have to mention 
[UnstoppableRobotNinja](http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/) for its layout and sort-of brownish color scheme 
and [Jeff Croft](http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2008/feb/15/its-brown-yo/) for his recent redesign and advocation 
of brown websites.
