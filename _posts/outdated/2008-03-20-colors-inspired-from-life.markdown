<h1>Colors, Inspired from Life</h1>
<p>Yesterday I listed quite a few sites from which I picked a few aspects of design that I liked.  I was looking more towards the layout and feel than the color but I did note a few palettes that I liked.  Yesterday evening I was shopping in my local Old Navy and I noticed the colors being used in the decorations for the men's side of the store.  A solid brown wash with blue and white "boxes" and orange circles.  I liked it so I snapped a quick picture with my phone and after playing for a while with different shades I came up with something like&nbsp;this.</p>
<p><img src="images/color-study.gif" border="0" alt="color_study.gif" width="400" height="276" class="clear"></p>
<p>It's pretty abstract for now, and it doesn't offer any of the texture or depth I'm looking for, but as a palette, I'm very&nbsp;happy.</p>
<p>To add to my list from yesterday, I love the footer on <a href="http://www.andyrutledge.com/styling-text-links.php#fragment-1">Design View</a> and <a href="http://5thirtyone.com/">5thirtyone's homepage</a> is amazing (<a href="http://is.derekpunsalan.com/">Derek Punsalan's portfolio</a> is also very impressive, I love the header and footer, but they're not really what I'm looking for).  Of course since I'm considering brown, I have to mention <a href="http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/">UnstoppableRobotNinja</a> for its layout and sort-of brownish color scheme and <a href="http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2008/feb/15/its-brown-yo/">Jeff Croft</a> for his recent redesign and advocation of brown&nbsp;websites.</p>
