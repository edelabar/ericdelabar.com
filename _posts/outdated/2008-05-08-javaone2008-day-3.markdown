<h1>JavaOne 2008 &ndash; Day 3</h1>
<p>Day two's keynote was from Intel, basically the same as <span class="caps">AMD</span>'s evening general session yesterday.  Blah, blah, blah, we improved <span class="caps">JVM</span> performance, blah, blah,&nbsp;blah.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, it was off to Groovy and Grails: Changing the Landscape of Java Platform, Enterprise Edition Patterns, which was unfortunately a bust.  I think I'm grails'd out.  The only thing new here was a couple new metaprogramming methods that I probably would have found by myself.  Not that it was a bad session, it was just the same as the other Groovy sessions so&nbsp;far.</p>
<p>Next came Mylyn: Code at the Speed of Thought.  <strong>Very</strong> cool.  I can see <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/">Mylyn</a> being very useful, especially when dealing with junior developers.  <a href="http://tasktop.com/blog/">Mik Kersten</a>, the presenter and the Mylyn creator, also noted that there was a "statisticly significant increase in the productivity of a 100-developer test group."  Sounds promising, but I'll need to play with it to see if it will fit into my employer's&nbsp;methodology.</p>
<p>There were other sessions, but the only other one worth mentioning was Developing Semantic Web Applications on the Java Platform, which was a panel moderated by <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/">Henry Story</a>, Sun's Semantic Web Evangelist (I want an evangelist job title!)  From this session, I was introduced to <a href="http://www.twine.com/">Twine</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/ajar/tab">Tabulator</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/01/rdxh/spec"><span class="caps">GRDDL</span></a>, and <a href="http://www.mulgara.org/">Mulgara</a>.  Definitely worth a little more&nbsp;investigation!</p>
<p>Tonight was JavaOne after dark, the closing party held on Thursday night so that everyone can catch a red-eye home tomorrow night.  This year's bash featured <a href="http://www.smashmouth.com/">Smash Mouth</a>, and turned out to be pretty entertaining when they played a few <a href="http://www.led-zeppelin.com/">Zepplin</a> songs before closing the show.  (An amused on-looker said they ran out of their own songs so they started playing something people would know!)  I was able to grab some video with my camera, which I'll post to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/edelabar" rel="me">YouTube</a> when I get home, but sadly there was no encore and we were back in the hotel by&nbsp;9pm.</p>
