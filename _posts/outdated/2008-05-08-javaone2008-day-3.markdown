Day two's keynote was from Intel, basically the same as AMD's evening 
general session yesterday.  Blah, blah, blah, we improved JVM performance, 
blah, blah, blah.

With that out of the way, it was off to Groovy and Grails: Changing the Landscape of Java Platform, 
Enterprise Edition Patterns, which was unfortunately a bust.  I think I'm grails'd out.  The only 
thing new here was a couple new metaprogramming methods that I probably would have found by myself. 
Not that it was a bad session, it was just the same as the other Groovy sessions so far.

Next came Mylyn: Code at the Speed of Thought.  **Very** cool.  I can see 
[Mylyn](http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/) being very useful, especially when dealing with 
junior developers.  [Mik Kersten](http://tasktop.com/blog/), the presenter and the Mylyn 
creator, also noted that there was a "statisticly significant increase in the productivity of a 
100-developer test group."  Sounds promising, but I'll need to play with it to see if it will fit 
into my employer's methodology.

There were other sessions, but the only other one worth mentioning was Developing Semantic Web 
Applications on the Java Platform, which was a panel moderated by [Henry Story](http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/), 
Sun's Semantic Web Evangelist (I want an evangelist job title!)  From this session, I was introduced to 
[Twine](http://www.twine.com/), 
[Tabulator](http://www.w3.org/2005/ajar/tab), 
[GRDDL](http://www.w3.org/2004/01/rdxh/spec), and 
[Mulgara](http://www.mulgara.org/).  Definitely worth a little more investigation!

Tonight was JavaOne after dark, the closing party held on Thursday night so that everyone can 
catch a red-eye home tomorrow night.  This year's bash featured [Smash Mouth](http://www.smashmouth.com/), 
and turned out to be pretty entertaining when they played a few [Zepplin](http://www.led-zeppelin.com/) 
songs before closing the show.  (An amused on-looker said they ran out of their own songs so 
they started playing something people would know!)  I was able to grab some video with my camera, 
which I'll post to [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/edelabar" rel="me) when I get 
home, but sadly there was no encore and we were back in the hotel by 9pm.
