In case any of you missed my [tweet](http://twitter.com/edelabar/statuses/805133233), 
I learned so much today that it actually took me a good twenty minutes to remember what my first 
session was about!

I eventually remembered, it was The Duke and the Elephant: PHP Meets 
Java.  Interesting concept, but doesn't seem ready for prime-time quite yet because it does not 
support JIT compiling the 
[PHP](http://www.php.net/) to bytecode like the other 
scripting languages like [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) and 
[JRuby](http://jruby.codehaus.org/) do.  If you're interested, the project is 
[WebSphere sMash](http://www-306.ibm.com/software/webservers/smash/) and it is being developed by 
IBM and falls under the umbrella of the [ProjectZero incubator](http://www.projectzero.org/). 
It is being developed transparently, the source code is available, but it is **not** 
open source.

Session number two was by far the best of the day, JAX-RS: The Java API 
for RESTful Web Services.  This session covered the basics of [REST</acronym>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer"><acronym title="Representational State Transfer) 
and then went through an incredible live-coded example using the [JSR-311](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311) 
[reference implementation Jersey](https://jersey.dev.java.net/).  I love the simplicity 
of the annotations and the fact that Jersey can run as a Java SE app 
without a web container opens the door for some interesting implementations.

The next two sessions really weren't that interesting, but after dinner I went back to the Moscone 
Center for Jersey - RESTful WebServices Made Easy.  This session was not as technical as the 
JAX-RS session, but still provided some neat 
demos (including an example using a SunSpot), and offered some insight into the Jersey project. 
Because I enjoyed the REST sessions so much I'll be checking out the 
blog's of the presenters: [Marc Hadley](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/mhadley/), 
[Paul Sandoz](http://blogs.sun.com/sandoz/), and 
[Jakub Podlesak](http://blogs.sun.com/japod/).

So far, other than the food, I'm very impressed with [JavaOne](http://java.sun.com/javaone), 
and I might even go as far as saying it is better than 
[TheServerSide Symposium](http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/lasvegas/index.html) was last year. 
Although the Cult-of-Java is almost as extreme as the Cult-of-Apple, which I do find pretty odd. 
The keynote was entertaining and interesting, but not **that** interesting!
