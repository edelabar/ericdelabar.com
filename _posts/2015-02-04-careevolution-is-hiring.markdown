If you'd like to work with me and the other amazing people at [CareEvolution](http://letsfixhealthcare.com/), we have some new job postings up on StackOverflow Careers:

* [Devs sought for Health Information Exchange (HIE) platform vendor at CareEvolution](https://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/39897/devs-sought-for-health-information-exchange-hie-careevolution?a=1f0zH6n4xIykEqT6&utm_source=careers.stackoverflow.com&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=company-job-list)
* [DevOps sought for Health Information Exchange (HIE) platform vendor at CareEvolution](https://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/40258/devops-sought-for-health-information-exchange-careevolution?a=1f0zH6uzVF0Ez3fG&utm_source=careers.stackoverflow.com&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=company-job-list)

Open to US Residents.  The core codebase is C# but there's a lot of JavaScript using [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) and a little iOS work as well.  CareEvolution scores 11/12 on the [Joel Test](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html).

At some point in the process you may think to yourself, "Self, this is too good to be true. It can't possibly be real."  I did the same thing.  I expected a "but" for weeks, pinching myself every day.  Now, I'm three-months in and I still haven't found a "but" and  I'm thrilled to go to work every day!  (Oh, and by "go to work" I mean put on my slippers and wonder into my home office.)
