In a [reflective post yesterday](http://www.manton.org/2015/06/clever-code-and-wwdc.html) [Manton Reece](http://www.manton.org/) of the [Core Intuition podcast](http://www.coreint.org/) precisely summed up the concerns I've had since Apple's announcement of Swift at WWDC 2014:

> I also believe that a programming language can either encourage or discourage clever code based on the syntax it allows. I saw it with Ruby — programmers intent on fitting as much logic into a single line of code as possible. I think I see it with Swift as well, in operator overloading and maybe even a kind of rejection of Objective-C’s notorious verbosity. We’ll know for sure if we eventually see a Swift book in the pattern of JavaScript: The Good Parts.

Ruby developers like to call this fit-all-my-logic-in-one-line code "expressive."  Type less, do more; I would see the appeal 30 years ago when everyone was hacking on an 80-column terminal in emacs or vi.  Today, we have powerful IDEs with code completion, snippets, and refactoring tools.  I can write hundreds of characters of code in a handful of keypresses; and due to the beautiful verbosity of the Objective-C/Cocoa code we're used to, it's self documenting and easy to read by somebody new to the language/frameworks/app.  

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the syntax of Swift, and I'm very happy with the way *Apple* is writing it in all of their WWDC 2015 slides. However, it's the factions of the community at large that want to take it in a more "expressive" direction that worry me.   

We're half-way through this year's WWDC I've finally resigned myself to the fact that after the Xcode 7 official release in the fall, I will be learning and using Swift in production code.  Personally, I'm going to try and do it like a Objective-C developer, with self-documenting and beautifully-verbose syntax, but I hope I'm not alone.
