<h1>Identity and OpenId</h1>
<p>It all started last week when I read <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/webapps/the-thrill-of-launch">an article on Vitamin about the launch of ClickPass at SxSW</a>.  I'd noticed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">OpenID</a> before, mainly on the <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/">Ma.gnolia</a> login page, but I never really saw a reason to get one for a single site.  Today, I finally decided to check it&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>I started at <a href="http://www.clickpass.com/home">ClickPass</a>, which lead me to <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID.net</a>, which listed a page containing <a href="http://openid.net/get/">all of the OpenIds that I already have</a>.  Not really wanting to tie myself to a particular web app, I choose <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/">myOpenID</a> because I liked the logo.  I quickly created an account, then noticed that you could get a myOpenID for a domain, since I own <a href="http://delabar.org/" rel="me">delabar.org</a>, <a href="http://openid.delabar.org/">openid.delabar.org</a> was born.  After some quick configuration, I had <a href="http://openid.delabar.org/eric" rel="me">my open personal OpenID</a> that was easy for me to remember and ready to use.  Very&nbsp;cool.</p>
<p>Looking into the topic further, I found <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/01/03/OpenID-for-non-SuperUsers">Sam Ruby's instructions for setting up OpenId without using a service</a>, interesting from a privacy perspective since you're in complete control of your information, but at the same time you lose the third party verifying your identity.  Leaving that debate for another day, the best part of the post was the first section where Sam talks about using delegation to claim your blog.  With a simple block of code in your html head, something like the following, you can use your blog as your&nbsp;OpenID.</p>

<p>Using this <a href="http://www.openidenabled.com/resources/openid-test/checkup">quick test</a> I verified this, and I can now use my blog <span class="caps">URL</span> as my OpenID.  Now, what is my reason for doing that?  I really don't have one, since I'm already using my own domain as my OpenID. However, if I was using some other OpenID, like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ericdelabar" rel="me">my Flickr <span class="caps">URL</span></a> for example, I would have a level of redirection that would allow me to swap <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ericdelabar" rel="me">Flickr</a> out for <a href="http://www.technorati.com/people/technorati/edelabar" rel="me">Technorati</a> without having to go and re-authenticate at all of my sites that use OpenID.  Now, let's bring in the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/">Social Graph</a>, a quick bit of <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/"><span class="caps">XFN</span></a> code in my link above, and now my OpenID identification page is part of my social&nbsp;graph.</p>
