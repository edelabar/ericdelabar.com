I guess Wordpress finally got fed up with me not updating my theme to the latest version; so the last upgrade finally killed the site.  Luckily, a few months ago I had already re-started a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) redesign I actually started a few years ago, back when Jekyll was new and popular.  So, with a little polish and brand-new deploy script, here we are! (I'm not technically finished, but if I waited until I was, there'd still be a broken Wordpress install sitting here.)

If you haven't noticed the header yet, I'm not really much of a web developer anymore, I've been concentrating mainly on iOS for the past 4 years or so, so that's the new topic for this site.  Like last time, I'm still most-interested in UI development, so expect to find articles about Interface Builder, Autolayout, Storyboards, and Animation.  That is, if I actually manage to write anything.  

This time around the site is fully-static, which means no comments.  I kept any interesting comment threads from the past, but killed the rest. Sorry. (Not really.) If you're interested, see the [Colophon](/colophon.html) for details on what makes this site tick. There's also an updated "[About](/about.html)" page and a brand new "[Projects and Code](/projects.html)" page as well.
